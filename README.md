# Global Calendar

Global calendar is a scheduling service that provides a convenient way to schedule events across different time zones. 

Students and employees working remotely may reside in a time zone different to the time zone of their institution or employer. Attending events including scheduled meetings, classes, and online presentations becomes inconvenient when the times they are set in do not correlate with the time zone a remote student resides in. Global calendar solves this problem with time conversion, whilst also providing a user-friendly interface to view and edit their own calendar schedule.

Through Software as a Service, Scrum, and Agile methodologies we developed a strong backbone for our desired web service. Utilizing technologies including WebSorm, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and Google OAuth, significant progress was made on both the frontend and the backend. A NoSQL database consisting of entities describing users, events, and calendars was created. Multiple web pages were developed to interact with the database, allowing users to view and create scheduled events.
